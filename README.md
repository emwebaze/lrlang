The Workshop on Cultures of AI and AI for Culture to be held _virtually_ as part of  [NeurIPS 2022](https://nips.cc/) on **December 9**. This is a cross-disciplinary workshop with experts in AI/ML and social sciences discussing how AI influences culture and how culture influences AI.  


# Description

AI development and deployment is shaped by the particular perspectives of the people and institutions it emerges from. Research in AI and ML have shown how human values and biases are baked into AI for instance through annotation practices, training data pipelines, model design choices and through larger organizational incentives.  At the same time, AI-driven  technologies are also actively shaping human experiences through art, music and language production tools which curate content and shape consumption patterns.

This relationship between AI and such human processes suggests a relationship between AI and what we can broadly call 'culture': a set of worldviews, beliefs and social practices.  Thus, knowing how AI influences culture (e.g. through content creation or recommendation tools) and how culture influences AI (e.g. through cultural values implicit in systems) becomes an important topic for AI research and development. While nascent conversations in the field have started to question the impact of AI-driven tools on global cultures and the western-centric cultural biases embedded within AI development, foundational research in AI/ML lacks a deeper understanding of what culture is and the ways in which it relates to AI research and development.  

Producing culturally sensitive, responsive, and competent AI systems requires us to think about the cultures shaping AI production and  about the impact these systems have on global cultures. Without understanding the role of the cultures shaping  AI-driven technology, we can not fully respond to  or diagnose the biases we are unconsciously globalizing through AI development.  Complexifying our understanding of culture is also increasingly salient as AI researchers become involved in designing AI with enormous cultural impact such as AI-generated art. 

This workshop brings together experts on AI development from the NeurIPS and ML community and places them in conversation with experts on human biases and cultural theories from HCI and the social sciences.  Although the NeurIPS community plays a vital role in AI development, researchers from outside of machine learning bring key perspectives and methodologies for the empirical study of culture and add nuance to the various ways in which AI and culture intersect.

To this end, the workshop program will focus on the following themes:

1. **Cultures Shaping AI**: How does culture influence assumptions and biases embedded within AI? How do the socio-cultural contexts where AI is developed impact its contours? What harms occur when AI is produced through specific cultural lenses and then deployed and experienced within different global cultural contexts? 
2. **AI Curating Culture**: How do AI systems (like recommender systems and language technologies) curate and influence culture? What impact do these technologies have on cultural production and consumption? Which dominant cultures are being centered in the design of these technologies?
3. **Methods for the AI & Culture Entanglement**: What methods and orientations would facilitate understanding the role of culture in AI and AI in culture? What methods can be used to de-center Silicon Valley-centric cultural lenses from AI development to include a broader set of practices? Are there ways that a positive cultural entanglement between society and AI that researchers can promote?

Through a series of inter-disciplinary discussions this workshop will: (a) define the space of problems around AI and culture; (b) stimulate field and theory building around AI and culture; (c) help researchers brainstorm methods and practices for studying AI and culture; and (d) reflect on integrating AI and culture into the research and engineering of AI systems.
